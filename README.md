# FoliumMappingTwitterAPI

Repository contains a python script that demonstrates how to scrape the Twitter API for tweets. The script prompts the user for a location where they would like to initialize a map of the tweets returned. The script then asks the user to input text that will be used to search for tweets. Finally, the tweets are added as markers to a map built with the Folium Python library.
